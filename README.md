## Docs
[Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/) | [Notion page](https://www.notion.so/Spotify-Web-API-3d5b5453a1f6436b89fc2d3efc98d88a)


The following repo handles the user authentication to Spotify using the Oauth token.
Once the user is authenticated, a list of infos about songs, artists, playlists and so on is fetched (look into the notion link above).

For now a draft implementation of the user auth is present.
This repo is of the backend side, so only the spotify Oauth token handling will have further development
